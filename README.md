# Project_Bluefish
A project to help me learn about Augmented Reality. This is an AR app designed to allow the user to virtually interact with and learn about objects.

## Project Outline
Users will be asked to scan the environment briefly before being provided with an aiming reticle and a real world scale boundary guide. The user will be prompted to find an area the boundary fits on and so they can place the stage. 

Once placed, a circular stage area will appear with various models floating on its perimeter. The user can tap a model to focus it, at which point the model will animate to the centre and become full scale. The user can then move around and rotate the model to inspect from multiple angles.

As the user views certain parts of the model, annotations will appear giving greater information on the model area being viewed. In certain circumstances the user may be able to tap to focus/enlarge a particular area of the model.

The user should have the option to reposition the stage to a new area without losing where they were with their viewing. The user should also have the option to save the state of the session to come back to later on.
